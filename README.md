Gitlet is a version control program inspired by Github and CS61B's past project.  It has many of the same 
functions of Github, but completely stored on the device in question, with the list of functions below.
Functions : 
init 
add 
rm 
commit 
branch 
rm-branch
checkout
status
log
global-log
merge

This is used by putting the gitlet process file into a directory, then running the commands with
java gitlet.command.
